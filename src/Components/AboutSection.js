                    <h2>Little Lemon</h2>
                    <h3>Chicago</h3>
                    <p>
                        Little Lemon Chicago is a family owned Mediterranean restaurant located in
                        the heart of the city. The restaurant is run by brothers Mario and Adrian,
                        who have always had a passion for cooking and serving delicious food.
                        Growing up in a Mediterranean household, the brothers were exposed to traditional
                        recipes from an early age, and they decided to bring those recipes to the masses
                        with a modern twist. At Little Lemon, you can expect to find a menu full of classic
                        dishes with a creative twist that makes them stand out from the rest.
                        Whether you're looking for a quick lunch or a leisurely dinner,
                        Little Lemon Chicago is the perfect place to indulge in a delicious meal in a cozy
                        and welcoming atmosphere.
